    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup flour",
        "2 tsp baking powder",
        "1/2 tsp salt",
        "3/4 cup sugar",
        "2 tbsp cocoa powder",
        "1/2 cup milk",
        "1 tsp vanilla extract",
        "2 tbsp melted butter",
        "1 cup chopped walnuts",
        "1/4 cup cocoa powder",
        "1 3/4 cups hot water",
        "3/4 cup brown sugar"
    ],
    "directions": [
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.",
        "Grease an 8x8 inch baking dish.",
        "Sift the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and 2 tbsp of cocoa powder together.",
        "Mix the milk, vanilla and melted butter together in a separate bowl.",
        "Combine the two mixtures you just made and whisk together until smooth. Add the nuts. Pour into the prepared baking dish.",
        "Mix the brown sugar and 1/4 cup of cocoa together. Mix well and ensure all clumps are gone. Pour it over the top of the prepared dish.",
        "Gently and slowly pour the hot water over the entire batter. You are trying to keep it from disturbing the thicker batter layer under the brown sugar/cocoa you just put over the top.",
        "Bake for 40-45 minutes.",
        "Serve warm with vanilla ice cream!"
